        <h3>Chennai</h3>
        <p>Known as the gateway to South India, Chennai is the capital of Tamil Nadu. Chennai is a sprawling, busy and
            conservative city with deep traditions that are yet to give space to the rising western influence. Chennai
            doesn’t have well-renowned monuments or tourist attractions like some other cities in India yet, if you are
            willing to explore Chennai, it will show you why it is so special among travelers. </p>

    <div class="flexbox2">
        <h3>Pondicherry</h3>
        <p>An independent union territory on the east coast of South India, Pondicherry, is a place that no one would
            expect to find in India. Back in the 18th century, Pondicherry or Puducherry was a French colony that still
            retains a distinctly French flavor. Those who feel that they need a break from India but are low on a budget
            will surely enjoy the taste of French culture here and the laid-back environment. Spiritual seekers
            frequently visit Pondicherry due to Sri Aurobindo Ashram. Bordered by the Bay of Bengal, the Promenade and
            the French Quarter are the most happening parts of Pondicherry. </p>
